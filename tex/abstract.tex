	Since the beginning of the 2020, COVID-19 has widely spread all over the world and its been declared a pandemic. 
	COrona VIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infective disease caused by SARS-CoV2 virus. COVID-19 has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020, and its been declared as pandemic by OMS. Chest CT scans of aptients affected by COVID-19 have shown consolidation and ground glass opacities, so becomes very important to segment and quantify these regions in order to understand the infection pathogenesis, help diagnosis and monitoring the recovery of healed patients.\\ 
	In this theses I will propose an application of the color quantization as segmentation method for automatic identification of the infected regions in CT scans of COVID-19 affected patients.
