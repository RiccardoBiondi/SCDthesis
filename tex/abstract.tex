	COronaVirus Disease (COVID-19) has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020. It is an acute, highly contagious, infection disease mainly involving the respiratory system. 
	
	Chest CT scans of patient affected by this disease have shown peculiar patterns of Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) and Consolidation (CS). These patterns are made in relation with the severity and the stage of the disease. 
	
	In this scenario a correct and fast identification of these patterns is a fundamental task.  Up to now the the identification of these areas is made mainly using manual or semi-automatic techniques, which are time expansive and and subjected to the operator expertize. 
	
	In this work of thesis I prose an automated pipeline for the identification of GGO and CS. The pipeline achieves the segmentation by applying colour quantization as medical image segmentation technique. In this way I have obtained an hard classification based on voxel intensities. I have used the way in which digital images encodes colour information to takes into account also properties related to the voxel neighbourhood.
