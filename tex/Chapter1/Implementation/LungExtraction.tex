	\subsection{Lung Extraction}
	
	The lung extraction is the first step of the pipeline which aims to isolate the region of interest and to remove the non-lung regions on CT scan. 
	This purpose is achieved by the following steps : 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Pre-Processing
		
		\item De-Noising
		
		\item Global Treshold
		
		\item Reconstruction of wrongly removed lung regions
		
		\item Selection of the largest connected region
	\end{enumerate}
