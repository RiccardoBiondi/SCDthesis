	\section{Review on Image Segmentation Methods}

		During the years, several segmentation methods have been developed and they are based on a lot of different approaches. These methods can be classified into several way, for example we can divide them into \emph{supervised} or \emph{unsupervised} if they requires or not a set of training data, or can be classified according to the used information type, like \emph{Pixel classification methods}, which use only information about pixel intensity, or \emph{Boundary following} methods, which use edge information, etc. In this section I will provide a brief review on the main segmentation methods, organized in the same way as in ~\cite{ART:Pham}, that divides the methods in 8 categories: 
		\begin{enumerate}

			\item Thresholding, 

			\item Region growing,

			\item Classifiers,

			\item Clustering,

			\item Markov Random Fields models, 
	
			\item Artificial Neural Networks,

			\item Deformable Models,

			\item Atlas guided approaches.


		\end{enumerate}
