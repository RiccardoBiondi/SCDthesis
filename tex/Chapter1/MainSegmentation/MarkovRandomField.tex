\subsection{Markov Random Field}
	
	Markov Random Field (MRF) is not a proper segmentation method, but it is a statistical model that is used within segmentation methods which model the spatial interaction between neighbouring pixels. It is often incorporated in clustering algorithms such as K-means with a Bayesian prior probability.
		
	This model is used when most pixels belong to the same class as their neighbouring pixels, in this cases, any anatomical structure that consists of only one pixel has a very low probability of occourring~\cite{ART:Pham}.
	
	A difficulty of this model is that it is very sensitive to the parameters that control the strength of the spatial interactions. The other MRF disadvantage is that it is a very computationally expansive algorithm. However, despite these disadvantages, MRF are widely used to model segmentation classes and intensity inhomogeneities~\cite{ART:Pham}.
