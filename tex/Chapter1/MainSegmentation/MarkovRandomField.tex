	\subsection{Markov Random Field}
	
		Markov Random Field(MRF) is not a proper segmentation method but its a statistical model that's used within segmentation methods that model the spatial interaction between neighbouring pixels. It's often incorporated in clustering algorithms such as K-means with a Bayesian prior probability.\\
		This model is used because most pixels belong to the same class as their neighbouring pixels, this means that any anatomical structure that consist of only one pixel has a very low probability of occourring~\cite{ART:Pham}.\\
		A difficulty of this model is that it is very sensitive to the parameters that controls the strenght of the spatial interactions. An other MRF disavvantage is that requires computationally intensive algorithms. However, despite these disavantages, MRF are widely used to model segmentation classes and intensity inhomogeneities~\cite{ART:Pham}.
