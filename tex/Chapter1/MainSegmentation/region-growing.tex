\subsection{Region Growing Approach}

	Region growing approach allows extracting connected regions from an image. This algorithm starts at seed location in the image (usually manually selected) and checks the adjacent pixels against a predefined homogeneity criteria~\cite{INP:Withey}, based on intensity, and/or edges.   If the pixels met the criteria, they are added to the region. A continuous application of the rule allows the region to grow. 

	Like thresholding, region growing is used in combination with other image segmentation operations, and it usually allows the delineation of small and simple structures such as tumour and lesions~\cite{ART:Pham}.

	Regions growing can also be sensitive to noise: the extracted regions may have holes or even become disconnected. May also happen that disjoint areas become connected due to the partial volume effect. 

	When we use this approach we have to consider that for each region we want to segment a seed must be planted. There are some algorithms, related to the region growing, that does not require a seed point, like split and merge one. Split and merge operates recursively. The first step is to check the pixel intensity homogeneity: if they are not homogeneous, the region is split into two equal-sized sub-regions. This step leads to an over-segmentation, so a merging step is performed, which merge adjacent regions with similar intensities~\cite{INP:Withey}.
