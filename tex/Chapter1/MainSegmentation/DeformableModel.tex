		\subsection{Deformable Model}
			Deformable Model use an artificial, closed, contour/surface able to expand or contract over time and conforme to a specific image feature~\cite{INP:Withey}. This approach is physically motivated model-based thechnique for the detection of region boundaries~\cite{ART:Pham}.\\
			The curve/surface is placed near the desidered boundary and it is deformed by the action of internal and external forces that act iteratively. The external forces are usually derived from the image.\\
			This approach has the capability to directly generate closed parametric curves or surfaces from images and  an also incorporate smootness constraint that providesrobustness to noise and spurioous edges. \\
			However this approach requires a manual interaction to place the appropriate set of parameters.
