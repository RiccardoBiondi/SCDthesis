	\subsection{Medical Image Formats}
	
	Image file formats provide a standard way to store the information describing an image in a computer file. The file format describe describes how the image data are organized inside the image file and how the pixel should be interpretedby a software for the correct loading and visualization.
	
	Medical file formats can be divided in two categories: one that try to standardize the images generated by diagnostic modality(e.g. DICOM), the other that try to facilitate the post processing analysis (e.g. Nifti). 
	
	Both of these type of images stores image data and metadata (at the beginning of the file).
