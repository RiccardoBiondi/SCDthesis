	\subsection{Medical Image Formats}
	
 	Image file formats provide a standard way to store the information describing an image in a computer file. Moreover, file format describes how the image data are organized inside the image file and how the pixel should be interpreted by software for the correct loading and visualization.
 
	Medical file formats can be divided into two categories: one that tries to standardize the images generated by diagnostic modality(e.g. DICOM), the other that try to facilitate the post-processing analysis (e.g. Nifti). Both of them store image data and metadata at the beginning of the file.~\cite{ART:Larobina}. 
	
	\paragraph*{DICOM}, acronyms for Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine, is not only a file format but also a network communication protocol. The added value of its adoption in terms of access, exchange, and usability of diagnostic medical images is, in general, huge. Dicom File format establishes that the pixels data cannot be separated from the description of the medical procedure which leads to the formation of the image itself. The header also contains patient information such as name, gender, age, etc. So the header allows the image to be self-descriptive. 
	DICOM is born for only 2D images, so a 3D volume is described by a series of files containing the single slices.~\cite{ART:Larobina}. 
	
	\paragraph*{Nifti} primary goal is to provide coordinated and targeted service, training, and research to speed the development and enhance the utility of informatics tools related to neuroimaging. This file format uses the header to store information about image orientation image centre and origin. This avoids left-right brain hemisphere ambiguity. Even if this file is born for neuroimaging, can be used also to store other kinds of images like chest CT. The format is supported by many viewers and image analysis software like 3D Slicer, ImageJ and OsiriX~\cite{ART:Larobina}.
