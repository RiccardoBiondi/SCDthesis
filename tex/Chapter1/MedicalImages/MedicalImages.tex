	\section{Medical Images}
	
	A medical image is the representation of the internal structure or function of the anatomic region in the form of an array of picture elements (pixels/voxels). 
	This discrete representation result from a process that maps each numerical value in a position of the space. The number of pixels used for this representation is an expression of the details with which the anatomy of function can be depicted. The physical meaning of the data changes according to the image acquisition modality (CT, MRI, PET, etc.); for instance, we can consider the computed tomography (CT) case: 
	
	Computed Tomography (CT) is a medical imaging technique which aims to reproduce cross-section images and the 3D anatomy of the examined subject. Each data represents the capability of the corresponding volume to attenuate an x-ray beam. To match results from different scans, the beam attenuation is measured in Hounsfield Units(HU) : 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:HU}
		CT-number = 1000\times\frac{\mu - \mu_{H_2O}}{\mu_{H_2O}}
	\end{equation}
	Where $\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of the tissue, $\mu_{H_20}$ is the linear attenuation coefficient of the water, took as a reference. The linear attenuation coefficient of the air is considered as $0$, so the corresponding CT number is $-1000$. For the bones, that have a density double than water, the CT number is $1000$.
	
	Medical images can be characterized by $5$ properties: \emph{pixel depth, photometric, interpretation, metadata and pixel data}. 
	
	\paragraph*{Pixel depth} Pixel Depth is the number of bits used to encode the information of each pixel. Each value of the tensor is an integer of floating-point number belonging to a domain related to the image format. It is related to the memory space necessary to store the image and the amount of information we want to store in each pixel. Higher bit allows us to store more information but requires more memory~\cite{ART:Larobina}. The most common are $[0, 255]$ for $8-$bit integer image, of $[0, 1]$ for floats. Also, other formats are available, like $16-$bit integers, widely used to represent medical images. 
	
	\paragraph{Photometric Interpetation} The photometric interpretation specifies how the pixel data should be interpreted for the correct image display as a monochrome or colour image. We have to introduce the concept of \emph{number of channels}. Monochrome images have only one sample per pixel (GL intensity). To encode colour information into pixels, we typically need multiple samples per pixel and to adopt a colour model that specifies how to obtain colours combining the samples. Colour may be used to encode blood flow direction and velocity in Doppler ultrasound~\cite{ART:Larobina}. In this works, I have used colour to consider also voxels neighbouring information and different image gamma 
	
	\paragraph{Metadata} 
	Metadata are the information that describes the image. Metadata is typically stored at the beginning of the file and contains (at least) the image matrix dimension and photometric interpretation. In medical image formats, it contains also information about how the image was produced or about the patients~\cite{ART:Larobina}.
	
	\paragraph{Pixel Data} Numerical values of the pixels that are stored according to data type.
