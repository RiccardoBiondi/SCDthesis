	\chapter{Results}
	

	The developed pipeline was trained and tested on three datasets (Sant'Orsola, ZENODO and MOSMED), described in the first section. 
	After that I will discuss the segmentation performances. The main method for the evaluation were a quantitative comparison whit a gold standard segmentation, made and validate by $5$ experts with at least $2$ years of experience. In collaboration with Sant'Orsola, the pipeline results were compared with some semiautomatic segmentation by a blind evaluation made by experts.
	As a control also segmentation on healthy patient were made, in order to ensure that no lesion were detected. This kind of segmentation was useful also to find the main source of errors.
