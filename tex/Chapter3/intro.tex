	\chapter{Results}
	
	In this final chapter I will presents and discuss the results of the segmentation achieved by developed the pipeline.
	
	In the first section I will describe the dataset used to achieve and test the segmentation. After that i will show the actual segmentation results.
	
	The segmentation performances were measured by visual assessment, expert blind evaluation  and quantitative comparison with the gold standard segmentation. As a control also segmentation on healthy patient were made, in order to ensure that no lesion were detected.\\
	The centroid set used to obtain the segmentation is estimated on $10$ CT scans carefully selected from the available dataset, in order to obtain a uniform representation of each cluster.
