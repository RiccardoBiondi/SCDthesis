	\subsection{ZENODO}
	This dataset consists into $20$ CT scans of patients affected by COVID-19, labeled by two expert radiologists and verified by  third one. 
	The anatomic structures labeled are the left and right lung and the infections regions. 
	Each files is in nifti format and no metadata were available.
	
	Unfortunately only an half of the scans are in HU, the remaining are in 8-bit gray scale, which is not suitable to verify the pipeline since requires it as input an image in HU.
