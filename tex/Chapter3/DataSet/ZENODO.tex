	\subsection{ZENODO}

	This dataset consists of $20$ CT scans of patients affected by COVID-19, labelled by two expert radiologists and verified by the third one. 
	The anatomic structures labelled are the left and right lung and the infections regions~\cite{DATA:ZENODO}. 
	Each file is in nifti format and no patient metadata was available (Exept fro spatial information like voxel spacing, origin and direction).

	Unfortunately, only half of the scans are in HU, the remaining are in 8-bit grayscale, which is not suitable to verify the pipeline since requires it as input an image in HU.
