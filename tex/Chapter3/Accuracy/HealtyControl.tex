	\subsection{Healty Control}
	
	As a last benchmark I
	In this subsection I will discuss the results of the segmentation made on $8$ healthy controls scans. This kind of  test was performed as benchmark, in order to ensure that, in absence of lesion, no areas were detected. On the other hand, this kid of segmentation is useful since allow us to foundthe main sources of misclassified areas, which we will see are pepresented by motion artifacts-

On the fist case we can see that no area is identified since no lesion is present; In second one we can see how, in presence of motion artifacts, some false positives may raise.  }\label{fig:HealthyControl}

	In \figurename\,\ref{fig:HealthyControl} I've displayed two segmented scans from healthy control. We can see that, in a normal case, no lesions areas were detected; but in presence of artifacts, some misclassified regions appears.\\
	This results suggest that the main source of false positives is the presence of motion artifacts, caused by heartbeat and respiratory cycle.\\
	
	In the end we have verified that, in the most common case, no lesion areas were identified as we expect. On the other hand, in presence of motion artifacts, these may be misclassified as lesions and we have observed that this is one of the main source of false positives.
