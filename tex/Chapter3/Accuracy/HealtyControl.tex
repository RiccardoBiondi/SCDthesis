	\subsection{Healthy-Control}
	
	
	As a benchmark I have also segmented $8$ scans from healthy-controls. The expected results are that no areas are classified as GGO or CS. More specifically I am expecting a small percentage of false positives, that according to the specificity must be around $\sim 10^{-4}$.
	
	As we have seen, the pipeline seems to have an high specificity. As a benchmark I have performed the segmentation on CT scans of healthy-control. Since no ground glass areas is present. Considering the specificity I will expect a small rate of false positives ($\sim 10^{-4}$).
