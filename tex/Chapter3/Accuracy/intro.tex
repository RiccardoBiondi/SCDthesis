	\section{Results}
	
	In this section I will describe the results. Each one of the three available dataset was segmented. The segmentation, performed on DIFA servers takes less than $2\,min$ for each patient. The achieved segmentation will be matched with the manual segmentation available with the scans. Three different method were used : 
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Visual comparison, made collaboration with the Department of Diagnostic and Preventive Medicine of the Poloclinico Sant'Orsola - Malpighi, 
		
		\item Blind expert evaluation
		
		\item Quantitative comparison with the gold standard
	\end{itemize}

	Also segmentation on healthy controls was takes into account, in order to check that no area was selected and estimate the false positives.
