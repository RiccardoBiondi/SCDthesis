	I n this section I will describe and discuss the segmentation results. The segmentation was made on $123$ patients belonging from three different dataset: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sant'Orsola
		
		\item ZENODO~\cite{DATA:ZENODO}
		
		\item MOSMED~\cite{DATA:MOSMED}
	\end{itemize}

	For each scans also manual segmentation was available, however only $5$ scans provides labels such that can be considered as gold standard. Together with COVID-19 affected patients, also heathy controls were provided, which we have used as benchmark to ensure that no lesion areas were detected, or at least to have a measure of false positives.\\
	A visual assessment between the labels provided by ZENODO and MOSMED and our segmentation was made, in order to made a comparison . Moreover two more relevant check were made : 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Matching between our segmentation and gold standard; 
		
		\item Double blind check between our segmentation and manual ones.		
	\end{itemize}

	In the end, in the last part, we discuss the results.
