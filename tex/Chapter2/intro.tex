	\chapter{Results}
	
	In this chapter I will discuss the results of the segmentation. The pipeline was mainly tested on the samples kindly provided by Sant'Orsola hospital, even if also some test on MOSMED and ZENODO was made. The results involves both timing and quality of the segmentation. The centroids used for the segmentation where trained over the 83 CT scans provided by Sant'Orsola and were used for segment all the scans.\\
	I've also used the some healthy scan patient to ensure that no lesion areas are identified.\\
	As reference I've used some manual segmentation performed by expert radiologist. To match the grund truth and the label under test I've used as metrics the intersection over union(IoU).\\
