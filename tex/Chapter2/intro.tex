	\chapter{Lung Lesion Segmentation}
	
	In this chapter I will discuss the pipeline developed for the segmentation of GGO and CS areas in chest CT scans of patients affected by COVID-19.
	
	In the first section I will first start defining GGO and CS and then I will describe how color quantization was used to achieve the segmentation and the main pipeline structure; paying attention on the aims of each block.
	
	In the second section I will going into details on the actual pipeline implementation, describing how each step is achieved. Also a brief description of the of the used frameworks and tools was provided.
	
	In the end I will describe the routines used for the tuning of parameters, used to achieve a best segmentation performances.
