	\chapter{Results}
	
	In this chapter I will present the pipeline results. First of all I will describe the characteristics of each of the dataset used as benchmark, after that I will discuss the results about time performances and accuracy of the developed method.\\
	The centroids used for the segmentation were computed using the 83 CT scans kindly provided by Sant'Orsola hospital.
	This centroids were used to segment both healthy patient and patient affected by COVID-19, in order to verify that no GGO regions were found in helathy patients and the GGO are correctly identified in the other scans. To achieve this purpose I've match the labels estimated by the pipeline with some manual segmentation made by expert radiologist.
