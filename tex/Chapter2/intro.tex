 	The aim of this work of thesis is the developing of an automatic pipeline for the segmentation of Ground Glass Opacities and Consolidation areas in chest CT scans of patients affected by COVID-19. Austin, in \textit{Glossary of terms for CT of the lungs}~\cite{ART:Austin} has defined the GGO and CS as:
 	
	\begin{center}
		"\emph{Hazy increased attenuation of lung, but with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins; caused by partial filling of air spaces, interstitial thickening, partial collapse of alveoli,normal expiration, or increased capillary blood volume, which is different from consolidation in which bronchovascular margins are obscured.}
	\end{center}.

		\label{fig:CTLung}
	\end{figure}

	The starting point is the chest CT scans (\figurename\,\ref{fig:CTscan}). Firstly I have removed all the extra lung regions like body, bronchial structures and CT tube which are a potential source of false positives. Once we have obtained a scan as \figurename\,\ref{fig:lung} , we can notice that the different structures are characterized by similar grey level: the basic idea was to use the colour quantization for medical image segmentation, grouping voxels based on colour similarity, and assigning to each tissue a characteristic colour. This can be done since in CT scan exists a relationship between the tissue in the voxels and the Gray Levels used to display it, given by the Hounsfield Units(eq\,\ref{eq:HU}): the colours are proportional to HU, which are defined as a linear transformation of the linear attenuation coefficient($\mu$).

	We can consider different properties beside the single voxel intensity. As we can see, lesion areas involve many closest voxels: It is interesting to incorporate also neighbourhood voxel information in the colour quantization. Moreover, the contrast between sick and healthy areas may change according to the severity of the disease, so we can incorporate different gamma of the image, to enhance these regions.

	Adopting a colour model for the digital image allows encoding colour information in the pixels. Colour can be used to encode also voxel neighbourhood information assigning to each channel a different function of the image.

	Once I have, build the colour space. I have to find the characteristic colour of each tissue under study, which is represented by a centroid in this space. I have created a training dataset made of CT scans from different patients and applied a k-means clustering since it provides a good balance between segmentation performance and computational efficiency. K-means clustering requires prior knowledge about the number of clusters, which in our case is given by the anatomical structure of the lung. I have considered a cluster for each different anatomical structure: 

		\begin{itemize}
		\item Lung; 
		
		\item  Edges;
		
		\item Vessel surrounding bronchial structures;
		
		\item Bronchi.
		
		\item  Ground Glass Opacities and Consolidation;
		
	\end{itemize}
		
	Once I have estimated the centroids for each tissue, I have used them for the segmentation: each voxel of the image is assigned to the cluster of the closest centroids. The final pipeline structure is summarized in \figurename\,\ref{fig:Pipeline}.

The labelling step takes as input the multichannel image and the centroids, previously estimated by a training.}\label{fig:Pipeline}
	\end{figure}

	Except for the lung segmentation, the learning process for the GGO and CS segmentation is unsupervised. Once the centroids are estimated, the training step does not need to be repeated. Moreover, in the implementation, the building of the multichannel image is incorporated in the labelling step. As a consequence the final pipeline structure looks like in \figurename\,\ref{fig:FinalPipeline}.
