	\subsection*{Lung Extraction}
	
	This preliminary step is performed before both training and labelling and involves the managing of the HU, the isolation of lung regions and the removal of the main bronchial structures.
	The registration of the HU on a common space is necessary to overcome the issues that may arise from the different padding values used by the different manufacturer of the CT scans. Moreover, some noise may change air values of some regions, which will be not exactly $-1000$. During the scan acquisition, all the regions outside the CT tube aren't sampled, so to obtain a square $N\times N$ image for each slice some padding values are added, which different values according to the scan manufacturer. This registration allows overcoming some issues that may arise during the conversion of the image from $16$ to $8$ bit unsigned integers, required to operate with \textsc{OpenCV} functions.

	Lung segmentation is a pivotal pre-processing step in many image analyses such as identification and classification of lung pathologies~\cite{ART:Johannes}. The lung isolation allows to find a mask for the lung regions, and thus excluding all the body regions, the CT tube and the extra-lung organs like intestine and heart, avoiding the formation of false positives.

	Automatic lung segmentation algorithms are typically developed and tested on limited datasets and usually over a limited spectrum of visual variability by containing mainly cases without severe pathologies~\cite{ART:Johannes}. Rule-based approach, like thresholding, region growing, etc., usually fails for CT scans of patients with severe Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), as we can see in \figurename\,\ref{fig:UNetVSThr}. For these reasons to achieve the lung segmentation, I've used a pre-trained U-Net~\cite{ART:Johannes}~\cite{REP:lungmask}.

We can clearly see the missing areas in the first segmentation, correctly identified in the U-Net one.}\label{fig:UNetVSThr}
	\end{figure}

 

	This kind of segmentation includes in the lung region also motion artefacts and bronchial structures, which are the main source of false positives. To achieve a better segmentation a refinement process is performed, which aims to remove the main bronchial structures form the selected lung regions. 

	Bronchi have elongated shape respect to the other structure which usually is rounded: the basic idea was to use this kind of information. To perform this task, I have computed the covariant matrix of the derivative in a neighbourhood (\ref{eq:CovMat}) and the corresponding eigenvalues.
	 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:CovMat}
		M = \begin{bmatrix} \sum _{S(p)}(dI/dx)^2 & \sum _{S(p)}dI/dx dI/dy \\ \sum _{S(p)}dI/dx dI/dy & \sum _{S(p)}(dI/dy)^2 \end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation}
	 
 	If a particular region has an elongated shape, one of the eigenvalues (corresponding to the eigenvector in the direction of the structure) will be higher than the other, otherwise, both eigenvalues have a low one. I have applied this filter on each slice of the scans and took a map of the maximum eigenvalues. 
	\begin{figure}[h!]
		\centering
			\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{MaxEigenVal.png}
		\caption{From left to right: lung regions selected by the U-Net, maximum eigenvalues map of the lung. As we can see the U-Net does not exclude the bronchial structure from the lung, on the other hand, the maximum eigenvalues map delineates very well these regions. I have used this map to remove the unwanted bronchial regions.}\label{fig:MaxEigenval}
	\end{figure}


	In \figurename\,\ref{fig:MaxEigenval}, I've displayed the image after the lung segmentation by the neural network and the corresponding eigenvalues map. As we can see the higher values of the map correspond to the edges of the main bronchial structures. To create the mask for these structures, I have applied a fixed threshold to the map. Since the main bronchial structures are large, this process can remove only part of the edges, but the inner structure is preserved. To refine the segmentation, this process is repeated a second time, allowing a fine removal of the structures.
