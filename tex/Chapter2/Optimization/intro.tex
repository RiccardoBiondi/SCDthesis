	\section{Optimization}
	
	During each step of the pipeline, we have to set different parameters, like the kernel size for median and std filter, as well as the number of centroids to use for the segmentation. In this section, I will briefly describe how each one of these parameters was optimized, to obtain the best segmentation performances.
