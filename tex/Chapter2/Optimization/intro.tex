	\section{Optimization}
	
	During each step of the pipeline we have to set different parameters, like the kernel size for median and std filter, as well as the number of centroids to use fro the actual segmentation. In this section I will birefly describe how each one of these parameters was optimized, in order to obtain the best segmentation performances.
