	\section{Time Performances}
	
	An important point of the developed pipeline is that it must provide results in a small amount of time. In this section I will discuss the time performances. The timing was performed by taking into account each dataset and the number of slices in each scans,
	Since for this work I've to segment several scans (over $100$) I've used some script that allows to perform the two main step of the pipeline separately.\\
	So in the end I've computed the time for the lung extraction step and the labeling separately for each dataset. In case of the Sant'Orsola Data, I've also match the time of this pipeline with the one of one certified medical segmentation software.\\ The results are displayed in table
